# C-Compiler
Compiler for assembly language - capable of identifying compilation errors and translating code into encoded language.


Project by  Adi Panker & Inbar Dagan:

The folder contains a file named Symbol.as, which includes text and macros.

The text represents a case where the file runs successfully.

A makefile is provided, which compiles the main.c file.

After completing the compilation, the following command should be executed:

./main symbol


The code will process the symbol.as file and generate the following output files:

symbol.am - after macro expansion

symbol.ob - encoding output

symbol.ext
